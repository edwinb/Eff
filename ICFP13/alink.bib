Mostly based on bib on PE by Peter Sestoft.  (The annotations have all
been added locally, though).
		  
The collections is mainly of papers containing concrete examples of
partial evaluation, in addition to a few significant papers in partial
evaluation and reflection.

                      Smith's 3-Lisp language, is actually more
                      straightforward than you think. Anyone can build an
                      infinite tower of processors (where each processor
                      implements the processor at the next level below) by
                      employing some common sense and one simple trick. In
                      particular, it is {\em not} necessary to re-design
                      quotation, take a stand on the relative merits of
                      evaluation vs. normalization, or treat continuations as
                      meta-level objects. This paper presents a simple
                      programming language interpreter that illustrates how
                      this can be done. By keeping its expression evaluator
                      entirely separate from the mechanisms that implement
                      its infinite tower, this interpreter avoids many
                      troublesome aspects of previous self-referential
                      programming languages. Given these basically
                      straightforward techniques, processor towers might be
                      easily constructed for a wide variety of systems to
                      enable them to manipulate and reason about

      to study meta-programming aspects of self-applicable online program 
      specialization. The primitives of the language provide support for multiple 
      encodings of programs. An important component of online program specialization
      is the termination strategy. In this paper we show that such a representation 
      has the great advantage of simplifying generalization of multiply encoded data.
      We extend two basic methods to multiply encoded data: most specific 
      generalization and the homeomorphic embedding relation. Examples illustrate 
      their working in hierarchies of programs.},

                      type system for Lisp with explicit and full control of
                      bit-level data representations. This description uses a
                      reflective architecture based on a metatype facility.
                      This low-level formalism solves the problem of an
                      harmonious design of a class taxonomy inside a type
                      system. A prototype for this framework has been written
                      in Le-Lisp and is used to built the integrated type and
                      object systems of the {\sc Eu\_Lisp} proposal.",

                      programs are executed not through the agency of a
                      primitive and inaccessible interpreter, but rather by
                      the explicit running of a program that represents that
                      interpreter. In the corresponding virtual machine,
                      therefore, there are an infinite number of levels at
                      which programs are processed, all simultaneously
                      active. It is therefore a substantial question to show
                      whether, and why, a reflective language is
                      computationally tractable. We answer this question by
                      showing how to produce an efficient implementation of a
                      procedurally reflective language, based on the notion
                      of a {\em level-shifting} processor. A series of
                      general techniques, which should be applicable to
                      reflective variants of any standard applicative or
                      imperative programming languages, are illustrated in a
                      complete implementation for a particular reflective
                      LISP dialect called 3-LISP.",

  abstract =     "Reflective systems allow their own structures to be
                 altered from within. In a programming system reflection
                 can occur in two ways: by a program altering its own
                 interpretation or by it changing itself. Reflection has
                 been used to facilitate the production and evolution of
                 data and programs in database and programming language
                 systems. This paper is concerned with a particular
                 style of reflection, called linguistic reflection, used
                 in compiled, strongly typed languages. Two major
                 techniques for this have evolved: compile-time
                 reflection and run-time reflection. These techniques
                 are described together with a definition and anatomy of
                 reflective systems using them. Two illustrative
                 examples are given and the uses of type-safe reflective
                 techniques in a database programming language context
                 are surveyed. These include attaining high levels of
                 genericity, accommodating changes in systems,
                 implementing data models, optimising implementations
                 and validating specifications.",

      use of numerical indices which indicate the number of times that a program piece has been encoded. Evaluation of S-Graph-n is formalized via an operational semantics. This semantics is used to
      justify the fundamental operations on metavariables --- special-purpose tags for tracking unknown values in self-applicable online specialization systems. We show how metavariables can be
      used to construct biased generating extensions without relying on a separate binding-time analysis phase.",

                 first-class citizens just as functions are first-class
                 citizend in functional languages. The main novel
                 feature of the language is the use of types to record
                 the communication possibilities possessed by processes
                 and in this we give up the causality between
                 communications, i.e. the types do not model whether or
                 not one communication may takeplace before another. In
                 analogy with the semantics of the lambda-calculus, and
                 of CCS, we develop a structural operational semantics
                 for the language. We then prove that the operational
                 semantics preserves the types and we use this to give
                 examples of `errors' that cannot arise for well-typed

                 semantic descriptions of imperative programming
                 languages. We have used it to generate compilers for
                 both a toy language and a non-trivial subset of Ada.
                 The generated compliers emit absolute code for an
                 abstract RISC machine language that is assembled into
                 code for the SPARC and the HP Precision Architecture.
                 The generated code is an order of magnitude better than
                 that produced by compilers generated by the classical
                 systems of Mosses, Paulson, and Wand. Our machine
                 language needs no runtime type-checking and is thus
                 more realistic than those considered in previous
                 compiler proofs. We use solely algebraic
                 specifications; proofs are given in the initial model.
                 The use of action semantics makes the processable
                 language specification easy to read and pleasant to
                 work with. We view our compiler generator as the first
                 step towards user-friendly and automatic generation of
                 realistic and provably correct compilers.",

  abstract =     "Component software benefits include reusability and
                 interoperability, among others. What are the
                 similarities and differences between the competing
                 standards for this new technology, and how will they
                 interoperate? Object-oriented technology is steadily
                 gaining acceptance for commercial and custom
                 application development through programming languages
                 such as C++ and Smalltalk, object oriented CASE tools,
                 databases, and operating systems such as Next
                 Computer's NextStep. Two emerging technologies, called
                 compound documents and component software, will likely
                 accelerate the spread of objectoriented concepts across
                 system-level services, development tools, and
                 application-level behaviours. Tied closely to the
                 popular client/server architecture for distributed
                 computing, compound documents and component software
                 define object-based models that facilitate interactions
                 between independent programs. These new approaches
                 promise to simplify the design and implementation of
                 complex software applications and, equally important,
                 simplify human-computer interactive work models for
                 application end users. Following unfortunate tradition,
                 major software vendors have developed competing
                 standards to support and drive compound document and
                 component software technologies. These incompatible
                 standards specify distinct object models, data storage
                 models, and application interaction protocols. The
                 incompatibilities have generated confusion in the
                 market, as independent software vendors, system
                 integrators, in-house developers, and end users
                 struggle to sort out the standards' relative merits,
                 weaknesses, and chances for commercial success. Let's
                 take a look now at the general technical concepts
                 underlying compound documents and component software.
                 Then we examine the OpenDoc, OLE 2, COM, and CORBA
                 standards being proposed for these two technologies.
                 Finally, we'll review the work being done to extend the
                 standards and to achieve interoperability across them

  abstract =     "In this paper we introduce M-LISP, a dialect of LISP
                 designed with an eye toward reconciling LISP's
                 metalinguistic power with the {\em structural} style of
                 operational semantics advocated by Plotkin [28]. We
                 begin by reviewing the original definition of LISP [20]
                 in an attempt to clarify the source of its
                 metalinguistic power. We find that it arises from a
                 problematic clause in this definition. We then define
                 the abstract syntax and operational semantics of
                 M-LISP, essentially a hybrid of M-expression LISP and
                 Scheme. Next, we tie the operational semantics to the
                 corresponding equational logic. As usual, provable
                 equality in the logic implies operational equality.\par
                 Having established this framework we then extend M-LISP
                 with the metalinguistic {\em eval} and {\em reify}
                 operators (the latter is a nonstrict operator that
                 converts its argument to its metalanguage
                 representation). These operators encapsulate the
                 matalinguistic representation conversions that occur
                 globally in S-expression LISP. We show that the naive
                 versions of these operators render LISP's equational
                 logic inconsistent. On the positive side, we show that
                 a naturally restricted form of the {\em eval} operator
                 is confluent and therefore a conservative extension of
                 M-LISP. Unfortunately, we must weaken the logic
                 considerably to obtain a consistent theory of
                 reification.",

  abstract = {Techniques for reasoning about extensional properties of
functional programs are well-understood, but methods for analysing the
underlying intensional, or operational properties have been much neglected.
This paper begins with the development of a simple but useful
calculus for time analysis of non-strict functional programs with lazy
lists.  One limitation of this basic calculus is that the ordinary
equational reasoning on functional programs is not valid. In order to buy
back some of these equational properties we develop a non-standard
operational equivalence relation called {\em cost equivalence}, by
considering the number of computation steps as an ``observable'' component
of the evaluation process.  We define this relation by analogy with Park's
definition of bisimulation in {\sc ccs}. This formulation allows us to show
that cost equivalence is a contextual congruence (and thus is substitutive
with respect to the basic calculus) and provides useful proof techniques
for establishing cost-equivalence laws.

It is shown that basic evaluation time can be derived
by demonstrating a certain form of cost equivalence, and we give a
axiomatisation of cost equivalence which complete is with respect to
this application. This shows that cost equivalence subsumes the basic
calculus.

Finally we show how a new operational interpretation of evaluation
demands can be used to provide a smooth interface between this time
analysis and more compositional approaches, retaining the advantages
of both.},

                 execution cost in latently typed languages such as
                 Common Lisp and Scheme, especially on architectures
                 that provide no special hardware support. We present a
                 tagging optimization algorithm based on type inference
                 that is \begin{description} \item[global:] it traces
                 tag information across procedure boundaries, not only
                 withing procedures; \item[efficient:] it runs
                 assymptotically in almost-linear time with excellent
                 practical run-time behavior (e.g. 5,000 line Scheme
                 programs are processed in a matter of seconds);
                 \item[useful:] it eliminates at compile-time between 60
                 and 95\% of tag handling operations in nonnumerical
                 Scheme code (based on preliminary data);
                 \item[structural:] it traces tag information in higher
                 order (procedure) values and especially in structured
                 (e.g. list) values, where reportedly 80\% of tag
                 handling operations take place; \item[well-founded:] it
                 is based on a formal static typing discipline with a
                 special type {\tt Dynamic} that has a robust and
                 semantically sound ``minimal typing'' property;
                 \item[implementation-independent:] no tag
                 implementation technology is presupposed; the results
                 are displayed as an explicitly typed sources program
                 and can be interfaced with compiler backends of
                 statically typed languages such as Standard ML;
                 \item[user-friendly:] no annotations by the programmer
                 are necessary; it operates on the program source,
                 provides useful type information to a programmer in the
                 spirit of ML's type system, and makes all tag handling
                 operations necessary at run-time explicit (and thus
                 shows which ones can be eliminated without endangering
                 correctness of program execution). \end{description}
                 This agenda is accomplished by: \begin{itemize} \item
                 maintaining and tracing only a minimum of information
                 -- no sets of abstract colsures or cons points {\em
                 etc.} that may reach a program point are kept, only
                 their collective tagging information; no repeated
                 analysis of program points is performed; \item
                 scheduling processing steps such that each one
                 contributes to the final result -- no idle or partially
                 idle traversals of the syntax tree are performed;
                 instead all relevant constraints are extracted in a
                 single pass over the syntax tree; \item using
                 theoretically and practically very efficient data
                 structures; in particular, the union/find data
                 structure is used to maintain and solve the extracted
                 constraints. \end{itemize} This improves and
                 complements previous work on tagging optimization in
                 several respects. \begin{itemize} \item In the LISP
                 compiler for
                 S1~\cite{Brooks:Gabriel:Steele:acm:lfp:1982}, in
                 Orbit~\cite{Kranz:Kelsey:Rees:Hudak:Philbin:Adams:acm:cc:1986},
                 and in
                 Screme~\cite{Vegdahl:Pleban:acm:asplos:1989,Pleban:tiall:1991}
                 tagging optimization (representation analysis) is
                 typically performed for atomic types (numbers), based
                 on local control flow information. Our analysis is
                 global and based on abstract data flow information.
                 \item In TICL~\cite{Ma:Kessler:spe:1990} type analysis
                 of Common LISP programs relies on costly repeated
                 analysis and programmer type declarations. \item
                 Shivers~\cite{Shivers:acm:pldi:1988} similarly uses
                 potentially expensive and complicated data flow
                 reanalysis for type recovery in Scheme and relies to
                 some degree on programmer type declarations; his
                 analysis works on the CPS transform of a Scheme program
                 and as such the results are not presentable to the
                 user/programmer. \end{itemize} The main practical
                 contribution of our tagging optimization algorithm is
                 likely to be its combination of execution efficiency
                 and ability to eliminate tag handling operations in
                 structured data, especially in lists: Steenkiste and
                 Hennessy report that 80\% of all dynamic type checking
                 operations are due to list operations, most of which
                 are statically eliminated by our type inference
                 algorithm. The computed information can also be used
                 for unboxing and closure allocation (reference escape)
                 analysis, although this is not pursued in this paper.",

                 These are called ``abstraction-preserving'' because of
                 a connection with a definition of ``abstraction'' or
                 ``information-hiding'' mechanism. If there is an
                 abstraction-preserving reduction from one language to
                 another, then essentially every function on natural
                 numbers that is definable in the first is also
                 definable in the second. Moreover, regardless of the
                 set of first-order functions definable in either
                 language, no programming language with an abstraction

  CBS is a simple and natural CCS-like calculus where processes speak
  one at a time and are heard instantaneously by all others. Speech is
  autonomous, contention between speakers being resolved
  non-deterministically, but hearing only happens when someone else
  speaks.  Observationally meaningful laws differ from those of CCS.
  The change from handshake communication in CCS to broadcast in CBS
  permits several advances. (1) Priority, which attaches only to
  autonomous actions, is simply added to CBS in contrast to CCS, where
  such actions are the result of communication.  (2) A CBS simulator
  runs a process by returning a list of values it broadcasts. This
  permits a powerful combination, CBS with the host language. It
  yields several elegant algorithms.  Only processes with a unique
  response to each input are needed in practice, so weak bisimulation
  is a congruence. (3) CBS subsystems are interfaced by translators;
  by mapping messages to silence, these can restrict hearing and hide
  speech.  Reversing a translator turns its scope inside out. This
  permits a new specification for a communication link: the
  environment of each user should behave like the other user.
  
  This paper reports the stable aspects of an evolving study."

  Local area networks (LANs) and everyday speech inspire a model of
  communication by unbuffered broadcast. Computation proceeds by a
  sequence of messages, each transmitted by one agent and received by
  zero or more others. Transmission is autonomous, but reception is not.
  Each message is received instantaneously by all agents except the
  transmitter, but is read only by those who were monitoring it at the
  time; others discard it. As in CCS, agents learn about the environment
  only through the messages they read. Programming such a system is hard
  because we have to ensure that messages are read.

  Testing resembles a viva-voce examination. Observation, restriction
  and hidden actions differ from their CCS counterparts, as does testing
  equivalence.

  We capture this model in a Calculus of Broadcasting Systems (CBS). We
  use transition systems with transmit, read and discard actions.
  Discards are self-loops, and only auxiliary. We have some results on
  strong bisimulation and testing, but much work remains to make CBS
  tractable."

  abstract =     "{\em A Calculus of Higher Order Communicating
                  Systems\/} was presented in Thomsen [1989]. This
                  calculus considers sending and receiving processes to
                  be as fundamental as nondeterminism and parallel
                  composition. In this paper we present an investigation
                  of the foundation of the theory of this calculus,
                  together with the full proofs of all major theorems.
                  \par The calculus called CHOCS is an extension of
                  Milner's CCS in the sense that all the constructions of
                  CCS are included or may be derived from more
                  fundamental constructs. Most of the mathematical
                  framework of CCS carries over almost unchanged. The
                  operational semantics of CHOCS is given as a labelled
                  transition system and it is a direct extension of the
                  semantics of CCS with value passing. A set of algebraic
                  laws satisfied by the calculus is presented. These are
                  similar to the CCS laws only introducing obvious extra
                   laws for sending and receiving processes. The power of
                  process passing is underlined by a result showing that
                  recursion can be simulated by means of process passing
                  and communication.",

the type structure of of a programming language in the more robust
type structure of the typed lambda calculus.  This is done by
translating programs of the language into terms of the typed lambda
calculus.  Our translation, however, does not always yield a
well-typed lambda term.  Programs whose translations are not
well-typed are considered meaningless, that is, ill-typed.  We give a
conditionally type-correct semantics for a simple language with
continuation semantics.  We provide a set of static type-checking
rules for our source language, and prove that they are sound and
complete: that is, a program passes the typing rules if and only if
its translation is well-typed.  This proves the correctness of our
static semantics relative to the well-established typing rules of the
typed lambda-calculus."  }

implementation language for the {\vlisp} run-time system.  The
compiler and proof were divided into three parts: A transformational
front end that translates source text into a core language, a
syntax-directed compiler that translates the core language into
combinator-based tree-manipulation language, and a linearizer that
translates combinator code into code for an abstract stored-program
machine with linear memory for both data and code.  This factorization
enabled different proof techniques to be used for the different phases
of the compiler, and also allowed the generation of good
code. Finally, the whole process was made possible by carefully
defining the semantics of {\vlisp} PreScheme rather than just
adopting Scheme's.  We believe that the architecture of the compiler
and its correctness proof can easily be applied to compilers for
languages other than PreScheme."

  abstract =     "A basic dilemma in the design of a database
                 programming language is the choice between a
                 user-friendly language with a rich set of tailored
                 notations for schema definitions, query expressions,
                 etc., and a small, conceptually simple core language.
                 We address this dilemma by proposing extensible
                 grammars, a syntax-definition formalism for incremental
                 language extensions and restrictions based on an
                 initial core language.\\ The translation of programs
                 written in tailored object languages into programs of a
                 core language is defined via syntax-directed patterns.
                 In contrast to traditional macro-expansion and
                 program-rewriting tools, our extensible grammars
                 respect scoping rules. Therefore, it is possible to
                 introduce new binding constructs like quantifiers,
                 iterators, and type declarations, while avoiding
                 problems with variable captures and name clashes.\\ We
                 develop extensible grammars and illustrate their use by
                 extending the lambda calculus with let-bindings,
                 conditionals, and SQL-style query expressions. We then
                 give a formal description of the underlying parsing,
                 transformation, and substitution rules. We also
                 highlight some implementation details of a type-safe,
                 extensible parser package based on the concept of
                 extensible grammars developed for the Tycoon
                 programming environment.",

                 polymorphic functional languages that support
                 imperative constructs. The type and effect discipline
                 outperforms other polymorphic type systems. Just as
                 types abstract collections of concrete values, {\em
                 effects} denote imperative operations on regions. {\em
                 Regions} abstract sets of possibly aliased memory
                 locations. \par Effects are used to control type
                 generalization in the presence of imperative constructs
                 while regions delimit observable side-effects. The
                 observable effects of an expression range over the
                 regions that are free in its type environment and its
                 type; effects related to local data structures can be
                 discarded during type reconstruction. The type of an
                 expression can be generalized with respect to the
                 variables that are not free in the type environment or
                 in the observable effect.",

                 for programs that perform dynamic memory allocation and
                 de-allocation. At runtime, all values are put into
                 \emph{regions}. The store consists of a stack of
                 regions. All points of region allocation and
                 de-allocation are inferred automatically, using a type
                 and effect based program analysis. The scheme does not
                 assume the presence of a garbage collector. The scheme
                 was first presented in 1994 (M.~Tofte and J.-P. Talpin,
                 \emph{in} ``Proc. 21st ACM SIGPLAN-SIGACT
                 Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages,''
                 pp.~188--201); subsequently, it has been tested in the
                 ML Kit with Regions, a region-based, garbage-collection
                 free implementation of the Standard ML Core Language,
                 which includes recursive datatypes, higher-order
                 functions and updatable references (L.~Birkedal,
                 M.~Tofte, and M.~Vejlstrup, (1996), \emph{in}
                 ``Proc. 23rd ACM SIGPLAN-SIGACT Symposium
                 on Principles of Programming Languages,''
                 pp.~171--183). This paper defines a region-based
                 dynamic semantics for a skeletal programming language
                 extracted from Standard ML\@. We present the inference
                 system which specifies where regions can be allocated
                 and de-allocated and a detailed proof that the system
                 is sound with respect to a standard semantics. We
                 conclude by giving some advice on how to write programs
                 that run well on a stack of regions, based on practical
                 experience with the ML Kit.",

  abstract =     "As part of an effort to bridge the gap between the
                  theory and practice of program transformation, we
                  have designed a meta-language for transforming
                  functional programs.  The meta-language is sound in
                  preserving both value and termination properties of
                  programs (and is thus superior to the unfold/fold
                  methodology).  Our key contribution is an equational
                  specification of Scherlis's expression procedures, in
                  which we express the essence of expression procedures
                  as a single transformation rule.  Our approach has
                  the following advantages over both unfold/fold and
                  expression procedures: (1) all program derivations
                  are reversible; (2) many transformations can be done
                  which unfold/fold and expression procedures cannot
                  do; and (3) the proof of correctness is far simpler."

  abstract = "We explore the design space for type systems with
  polymorphic records.  We design record systems for extension,
  concatenation and removal of fields.  Furthermore, we design a record
  system where field labels become first class values.  That means, we
  can now quantify over field lables and pass them around as arguments.
  All designed record systems enjoy type inference with principal
  types. Especially, we can combine any features into a new record
  system retaining type inference with principal types.

  We also point out some problems which are present in previous record
  systems.  Our designed record systems can be seen as the proper
  logical formulation of previous approaches with even more expressive
  power.

   We base our design on the HM(X) framework. HM(X) is a general
  framework for Hindley/Milner type systems that are parameterized in
  the constraint domain X. HM(X) enables us to design record systems in
  a systematic way retaining type inference with principal types.  That
  means, designing record systems becomes construction of constraint
  systems which model record systems."  }

  abstract =     "Modern microprocessors require an immense investment
                 of time and effort to create and verify, from the
                 high-level architectural design downwards. We are
                 exploring ways to increase the productivity of design
                 engineers by creating a domain-specific language for
                 specifying and simulating processor architectures. We
                 believe that the structuring principles used in modern
                 functional programming languages, such as static
                 typing, parametric polymorphism, first-class functions,
                 and lazy evaluation provide a good formalism for such a
                 domain-specific language, and have made initial
                 progress by creating a library on top of the functional
                 language Haskell. We have specified the integer subset
                 of an out-of-order, superscalar DLX microprocessor,
                 with register-renaming, a reorder buffer, a global
                 reservation station, multiple execution units, and
                 speculative branch execution. Two key abstractions of
                 this library are the signal abstract data type (ADT),
                 which models the simulation history of a wire, and the
                 transaction ADT, which models the state of an entire
                 instruction as it travels through the microprocessor.",

  abstract =     "Specializing programs with respect to run-time values
                 has been shown to drastically improve code performance
                 on realistic programs ranging from operating systems to
                 graphics. Recently, various approaches to specializing
                 code at run-time have been proposed. However, these
                 approaches still suffer from shortcomings that limit
                 their applicability: they are manual, too expensive, or
                 require programs to be written in a dedicated language.
                 We solve these problems by introducing new techniques
                 to implement run-time specialization. The key to our
                 approach is the use of code templates. Templates are
                 automatically generated from ordinary programs and are
                 optimized before run time, allowing high-quality code
                 to be quickly generated at run time. Experimental
                 results obtained on scientific and graphics code
                 indicate that our approach is highly effective. Little
                 run-time overhead is introduced, since code generation
                 primarily consists of copying instructions. Run-time
                 specialized programs run up to 10~times faster, and are
                 nearly as fast as fully optimized programs (80\% on
                 average). The combination of low run-time overhead and
                 high code quality enables specialization to be
                 amortized in as few as 3~runs. Although this approach
                 is highly effective, its implementation is relatively
                 simple since it exploits existing partial evaluation
                 and compiler technologies.",

                 En effet, les sp\&eacute;cifications naturelles des
                 langages source et cible contiennent des termes
                 rationnels difficiles \&agrave; axiomatiser dans

                 cette difficult\&eacute;. In this report we show how we
                 proved correctness of the translation from a small
                 applicative language with recursive definitions
                 (Mini-ML) to the Categorical abstract machine (CAM)
                 using the Coq system. Our aim was to mechanize the
                 proof of J. Despeyroux \&bsol;cite\&lcub;Des\&rcub;.
                 Like her, we use natural semantics to axiomatise the
                 semantics of our languages. We have only partially
                 mecanised the proof. The semantics of the source and
                 target languages use rational trees in their definition
                 and at this stage the Coq system is inefficient in
                 axiomatising such structures. We propose a presentation
                 of the correctness proof to isolate this difficulty.",

                 instantiated. Starting with J.C. Reynolds' (1983) work,
                 the study of parametricity is typically semantic. The
                 authors develop a syntactic approach to parametricity,
                 and a formal system that embodies this approach: system
                 R. Girard's system F (J.Y. Girard et al., 1989) deals
                 with terms and types; R is an extension of F that deals
                 also with relations between types. In R, it is possible
                 to derive theorems about functions from their types, or
                 'theorems for free', as P. Wadler (1989) calls them. An
                 easy 'theorem for free' asserts that the type For all
                 (X)X to Bool contains only constant functions; this is
                 not provable in F. There are many harder and more
                 substantial examples. Various metatheorems can also be
                 obtained.",

  summary = {The ``size-change termination''  principle for a first-order
functional language with well-founded data is: a program terminates on all
inputs if {\em every infinite call sequence} (following program control flow)
would cause an  infinite descent in some data values.
Size-change analysis is based only on local
approximations to parameter size changes derivable from program syntax.
The set of infinite call sequences that follow program flow and can be
recognized as causing infinite descent is an
$\omega$-regular set, representable by a B\"uchi automaton.
Algorithms for such automata can be used to decide size-change termination.
We also give a direct algorithm operating on ``size-change graphs''
(without the
passage to automata).
Compared to other results in the literature, termination analysis
based on the size-change principle is surprisingly simple and general:
lexical orders (also called lexicographic orders), indirect function
calls and permuted arguments (descent that is not {\em in-situ}) are
all handled {\em automatically and without special treatment}, with no
need for manually supplied argument orders, or theorem-proving methods
not certain to terminate at analysis time.
We establish the  problem's
{\em intrinsic complexity}. This turns out to be surprisingly high,
complete for {\sc pspace}, in spite of the simplicity of the principle.
{\sc pspace} hardness is proved by a reduction from Boolean program
termination. An interesting consequence: the same hardness result applies
to many other analyses found in the termination and quasi-termination
literature.},

                 decreases for some data values. For an actual analysis,
                 {"}size-change graphs{"} are used to capture data size

                 sequence that respects program control flow is called a
                 {"}multipath.{"} Multipaths describe possible state

                 for PSPACE. In this paper, we explore efficient
                 approximations that are sufficiently precise in
                 practice. For size-change graphs that can loop (i.e.,
                 they give rise to an infinite multipath), and that
                 satisfy SCT, it is usually easy to identify among them
                 an {"}anchor{"}-- some graph whose infinite occurrence
                 in a multipath causes infinite descent. The SCT
                 approximations are based on finding and eliminating
                 anchors as far as possible. If the remaining graphs
                 cannot loop, then SCT is established. An efficient
                 method is proposed to find anchors among {"}fan-in
                 free{"} graphs, as such graphs occur commonly in
                 practice. This leads to a worst-case quadratic-time
                 approximation of SCT. An extension of the method
                 handles general graphs and can detect some rather
                 subtle descent. It leads to a worst-case cubic-time
                 approximation of SCT. Experiments confirm the
                 effectiveness and efficiency of the approximations in
                 practice.",
